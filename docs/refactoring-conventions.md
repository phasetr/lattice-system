# Refactoring conventions and review criteria

This document captures conventions and review criteria distilled
from the project's refactoring rounds. It is **applied as the
review checklist for every pull request**, not only refactor PRs.

The knowledge is grouped by phase / category so that reviewers can
locate the relevant criteria quickly.

## 1. Test methods (per refactor plan v4 §2.1)

The following table is the canonical menu of test idioms used in
this project. Each PR that adds or changes tests should be
checkable against it.

| Method | Code shape | Use |
|---|---|---|
| **A. decide-based universal** | `example : ∀ x : Fin n, P x := by decide` | Pin the meaning of a finite, `Decidable` predicate. Most refactor-resistant. |
| **B. matrix entry-wise on small `Fin n`** | `ext i j; fin_cases i <;> fin_cases j <;> simp [defn_apply]` | Cross-check small matrix-valued definitions. Catches meaning changes immediately. |
| **C. bridge identity** | `example : defn_A = defn_B := rfl` | Pin the consistency of two definitions of the same object. Refactor detector. |
| **D. signature-preservation shim** | `example : <type> := named_thm args` | **Limited** to public API freeze. Survives rename only of the body, not of the name. |
| **E. `Plausible`** | (POC only) | **Not primary.** Generator integration cost is high for our `ℂ` / matrix setting. |
| **F. `#guard_msgs`** | `/-- expected msg -/ #guard_msgs in <command>` | Pin diagnostic output: `@[deprecated]` warnings, intended failures, linter behaviour. **Not** for theorem regression. |
| **G. small exhaustive (`Fin n; fin_cases`)** | `example : ∀ x : Fin n, P x := by intro x; fin_cases x <;> simp` | Pin meaning of a parameterised lemma on a small but complete sample. The most refactor-resistant for parameterised statements. |

**Primary axis**: A + C + G. **Limited use**: D, B. **Niche**: F. **Not primary**: E.

### Review check — tests

When a PR introduces or modifies tests, the reviewer checks:

- [ ] Each module / cluster covered by at least one of A / C / G
  (not only D shims).
- [ ] If only D shims are added, the PR description justifies
  why A / C / G are not applicable (e.g., matrix-over-`ℂ` props
  are not `Decidable`).
- [ ] No test relies on internal namespace details that would
  break under a Phase 2 module split.

## 2. Module split conventions (per refactor plan v4 §3.1)

Module split criteria, all four required:

1. **Two or more clearly separable responsibilities.**
2. **Linear import DAG** after split (no cycles).
3. **Public API boundary** is clean.
4. **Tests already pin meaning** (depends on Phase 1 of the refactor).

### Façade module policy

Each split module retains a **façade module** that re-imports the
new files. This preserves backward-compatible import paths:

```
LatticeSystem/Quantum/NeelState.lean  -- façade (re-imports NeelState.*)
LatticeSystem/Quantum/NeelState/Definition.lean
LatticeSystem/Quantum/NeelState/Definition2D.lean
...
```

Old `import LatticeSystem.Quantum.NeelState` works unchanged.

### Helper visibility

When extracting a helper lemma from one file to another, if the
helper is referenced by other downstream files, it must be lifted
from `private lemma` to `lemma` at extraction time. Document the
visibility change in the PR body.

### Review check — module split

- [ ] All four split criteria justified in the PR description.
- [ ] Façade module retained at original path.
- [ ] No new module cycles introduced.
- [ ] Build-time delta recorded in the PR description.
- [ ] `[simp]` lemmas surveyed before split (cross-file
  dependencies on global simp set noted).

## 3. Generic / dedup conventions (per refactor plan v4 §3.2)

When consolidating duplicated patterns:

- **Public API uses set-based formulations** (e.g.,
  `(hpart : G.IsBipartiteWith s t)` with `s t : Set V`).
- **Internal lemmas use Bool-based formulations** (e.g.,
  `σ : V → Bool`) for `simp` ergonomics.
- Avoid abstract `IsBipartite` (Colorable 2) at entry points;
  prefer the explicit `IsBipartiteWith` witness form.

### Deprecation window

When generalising a definition, keep the **specialised version**
with a `@[deprecated <replacement> (since := "YYYY-MM-DD")]`
annotation. The deprecation window is at least one minor version
of the project (or one feature-cluster of subsequent PRs).

**Do not deprecate** until all bridge lemmas are in place and
verified.

### Review check — generic / dedup

- [ ] If deprecating, all bridge lemmas listed and merged first.
- [ ] `@[deprecated ... (since := ...)]` annotation present with
  explicit date.
- [ ] At least one `#guard_msgs` test pinning the deprecation
  warning text (per §1 method F).

## 4. Naming and docstring conventions (per refactor plan v4 §3.3)

- Theorem / definition names should aim for **≤ 60 characters**
  where readability is not sacrificed. Long names like
  `inner_basisVec_spinHalfDot_basisVec_antiparallel` (52 chars)
  are at the edge — acceptable only if no shorter alternative
  exists.
- Every `def` / `noncomputable def` / `theorem` / `lemma` must
  have a docstring.
- Tasaki-related results must cite the **equation number + page
  number** (e.g., `Tasaki §2.5 eq. (2.5.3), p. 37`).
- Comments inside proofs should be sparse: the proof itself, plus
  any **non-obvious WHY** (subtle invariant, hidden constraint,
  workaround). No redundant WHAT comments.

### Review check — naming & docstring

- [ ] Every new public name has a docstring.
- [ ] Tasaki / mathlib references are explicit (eq. number + page
  / mathlib symbol path).
- [ ] No theorem name > 80 characters (hard limit; soft limit 60).

## 5. Linter exception conventions (per refactor plan v4 §3.4)

- **No file-level `set_option linter.* false`** in source files
  (test files exempt only with comment justification).
- **In-line `set_option linter.flexible false in`** etc. are
  acceptable only when no proof-level rewrite achieves the goal;
  must include comment explaining why.
- `lake build` should produce **zero linter warnings** in steady
  state.

### Review check — linter

- [ ] No new `set_option linter.* false` introduced.
- [ ] If linter exception is removed elsewhere, build still passes.
- [ ] `lake build` warning count not increased (record before /
  after in PR description if relevant).

## 6. Public-doc synchronisation (CLAUDE.local.md, longstanding)

For every PR adding `def` / `theorem` / `lemma`, the same PR must:

1. Update `docs/index.md` table (Lean name + statement + file +
   citation).
2. Update Roadmap line if applicable.
3. Update `tex/proof-guide.tex` if relevant.

This is enforced by review and not by CI.

### Review check — public doc sync

- [ ] `docs/index.md` updated (or PR explicitly notes "no
  user-visible API").
- [ ] References to Tasaki / mathlib added where applicable.

## 7. Refactoring knowledge accumulation (this document)

This document is itself the **single source of truth** for
review criteria. When new conventions emerge (e.g., from a
Phase 2 split surfacing a new pitfall), the convention is added
here in the same PR that demonstrates it.

The goal is that **anyone reviewing a PR can apply this checklist
mechanically** and catch most regressions / drift.

### History
- **2026-04-22**: Initial version. Codifies the methods and
  conventions established in refactor plan v4 (Phase 0, Phase 1,
  early Phase 2). Origin: discussion during the §2.5 burst
  cleanup (#251–#278, then #279 + #280–#284 child issues).
