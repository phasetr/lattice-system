# Connectivity condition: classification (Tasaki §11.2.2, Theorem 11.8 and Lemma 11.9)

After **Definition 11.6** (`nagaokaConnectivity`) and **Theorem 11.7**
(`nagaoka_theorem_11_7`, proven in `NagaokaConnectivity.lean`), Tasaki §11.2.2
gives two criteria for *verifying* the connectivity condition on a concrete
bond graph `(Λ, B)`, `B = {{x, y} : t_{x,y} ≠ 0}`:

* **Theorem 11.8** (Bobrow–Stubis–Li): the connectivity condition holds *iff*
  `(Λ, B)` is biconnected and is not a simple loop (periodic chain) with more
  than four sites.
* **Lemma 11.9**: if `(Λ, B)` is connected by *exchange bonds*, the connectivity
  condition holds.

## Axiomatization rationale (project decision, 2026-06-04)

Both results are recorded here as **`axiom`s**, deferring their proofs to a
future implementation, for the following reasons.

* **Theorem 11.8.** Tasaki's text *explicitly leaves the proof to the original
  papers* — Bobrow, Stubis and Li, and Wilson's graph-theoretic analysis of the
  "15-puzzle" (Tasaki 1st ed., §11.2.2, p. 387, refs [4], [81]). The book itself
  provides no proof, so it is a *cited external classification theorem*. Rather
  than reproduce Wilson's theorem we axiomatize its statement.

* **Lemma 11.9.** Tasaki gives a proof (moving the hole around a length-3/4 loop
  to exchange the spins at an exchange bond). A faithful Lean proof would have to
  turn that "15-puzzle" hole-motion argument into a sequence of non-vanishing
  `Ĥ_eff` matrix elements connecting any two same-magnetization basis states
  (i.e. strong connectivity of the per-sector quiver of `−M`); this is a
  multi-PR effort in the present matrix/configuration framework. It is
  axiomatized now and deferred to a future implementation.

The *statements* are formalized here in book order; the *proofs* are deferred.
**Theorem 11.7 itself (`NagaokaConnectivity.lean`) is `sorry`-free and does not
depend on these axioms** — they are isolated in this file so that the proven
core stays axiom-clean.

`x ≠ y` and the hopping `t_{x,y}` (or its transpose) is non-zero.  The symmetric
closure is taken so the definition is a `SimpleGraph` without assuming
`t_{x,y} = t_{y,x}` (for symmetric `t` it is just the support of `t`). -/

/-- A graph is **biconnected** (non-separable) if it is connected and removing
any single vertex leaves it connected — there is no cut vertex.  (Tasaki fn. 10,
§11.2.2.)  The `G.Connected` conjunct excludes degenerate disconnected graphs
(e.g. isolated vertices), for which "delete any vertex stays connected" would
otherwise hold vacuously. -/

the cycle graph `C_n` for some `n > 4` (a periodic chain on `≥ 5` sites). -/

  ∃ n : ℕ, 4 < n ∧ Nonempty (G ≃g SimpleGraph.cycleGraph n)

/-- **Tasaki Theorem 11.8 (necessary and sufficient condition for connectivity).**
A Hubbard model with `U = ∞`, `N = |Λ| − 1` and `t ≥ 0` satisfies the
connectivity condition (Definition 11.6, `nagaokaConnectivity`) if and only if
its bond graph is biconnected and is not a simple loop with more than four sites.

**AXIOMATIZED (deferred to future implementation).**  Tasaki leaves the proof to
Bobrow–Stubis–Li and Wilson's "15-puzzle" theorem (1st ed., §11.2.2, p. 387,
refs [4], [81]); the book gives no proof, so this is a cited external
classification result.  See the module docstring for the rationale.  (`1 ≤ N`
excludes the degenerate single-site case, where there are no electrons to order.)

/-- The **exchange-bond graph**: an edge `x — y` whenever `{x, y}` (or `{y, x}`)
is an exchange bond.  The symmetric closure of `IsExchangeBond` (which is itself
symmetric in `x, y`) is taken so the definition is a `SimpleGraph` without a
separate symmetry proof. -/

parking, and mismatch reduction) on top of the predicates defined in this file. -/
