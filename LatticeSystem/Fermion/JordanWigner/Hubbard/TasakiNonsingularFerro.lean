# Tasaki §11.4.3: ferromagnetism in the non-singular Hubbard model (Theorem 11.20)

This file states Tasaki's culminating result of §11.4 — **Theorem 11.20**: a Hubbard model
on the decorated chain with a *nearly-flat* (non-flat) lowest band, obtained by perturbing
the flat-band model (§11.3.1), still exhibits saturated ferromagnetism for a suitable range
of parameters.  This is the first proof of ferromagnetism in a Hubbard model with no
singularity (finite density of states, finite `U`).

The model (eq. (11.4.38)) is `Ĥ = Ĥ_hop + Ĥ_int` with
`Ĥ_hop = t Σ_{u∈I,σ} b̂†_{u,σ} b̂_{u,σ} − s Σ_{p∈E,σ} â†_{p,σ} â_{p,σ}`  (`t, s > 0`),
i.e. the flat-band Hamiltonian (`t Σ b̂†b̂ + U Σ n̂↑n̂↓`) minus `s` times the
`α`-state number operator.  At `s = 0` it is the flat-band model.

**Theorem 11.20** (`d = 1` version): for every `ν > 0` there are thresholds (depending only
on `ν`, not on the system size) such that, once `t/s` and `U/s` are large enough, the model
exhibits ferromagnetism (`E_min(S_max) < E_min(S)` for all `S ≠ S_max = N/2`; the ground
states are the `2S_max+1 = N+1`-fold maximal-spin multiplet).  Tasaki's proof (via the
frustration-free local Hamiltonians `ĥ_p` on `4d+1` sites — Lemmas 11.21, 11.22 — reducing
to Theorem 11.11) is deep and deferred; this is a documented axiom (Theorem 11.8 / 11.13 /
11.15 / 11.18 / 11.19 policy).

model (`flatBandHamiltonian`) with the additional hopping `−s Σ_{p∈E,σ} â†_{p,σ} â_{p,σ}`

/-- **Tasaki Theorem 11.20 (ferromagnetism in the non-singular Hubbard model), AXIOM**
(`d = 1` version).  For every `ν > 0` there are thresholds `T, V > 0` (depending only on `ν`,
uniformly in the system size `K`) such that, whenever `t/s ≥ T` and `U/s ≥ V` (with
`t, s, U > 0`), the Tasaki non-singular Hubbard model exhibits saturated ferromagnetism:
`E_min(S_max) < E_min(S)` for all `S ≠ S_max = N/2` (electron number `N = |E| = K+1`,
`twoS_max = K+1`).  Tasaki proves this via Lemmas 11.21/11.22 (the frustration-free local
Hamiltonians `ĥ_p`) and a reduction to Theorem 11.11; the proof is deep and is recorded here
as a documented axiom. -/
