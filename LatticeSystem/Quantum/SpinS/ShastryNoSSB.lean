# Tasaki §4.1: absence of symmetry breaking in one dimension (Theorem 4.2, Shastry)

For the one-dimensional spin-`S` antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a ring of `L` sites under a
staggered magnetic field (eq. (4.1.9)),
`Ĥ_h = Σ_x Ŝ_x · Ŝ_{x+1} − h Σ_x (−1)^x Ŝ_x^{(3)}` (periodic, `Ŝ_{L+1} = Ŝ_1`),
Shastry's theorem (Theorem 4.2) asserts that the staggered order parameter vanishes in the iterated
thermodynamic-then-zero-field limit (eq. (4.1.10)):
`lim_{h↓0} lim_{L↑∞} ⟨Φ_GS,h| Ô_L^{(3)}/L |Φ_GS,h⟩ = 0`,
so the model never exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking even though the staggered field is
designed to enhance the staggered moment.

Tasaki does **not** prove Theorem 4.2 (the original argument of Shastry [58] is not stated as a
mathematical theorem; a rigorous formulation is in [63]).  We record it as a documented axiom,
stated faithfully and soundly over the concrete one-dimensional ring family: the order parameter is
normalized per site, the ground states are *normalized* energy-minimizing eigenvectors (so the bound
is scale-invariant), and the double limit is written in explicit `ε`–`δ` form (for every `ε > 0`
there is a field threshold `h₀`, and for each small field a size threshold `L₀`, beyond which the
per-site staggered moment is `< ε`).  The deep argument behind it (a thermodynamic / infinite-volume
statement) is deferred; infinite-volume systems are in scope (the project's central long-term goal).

This file defines the ring nearest-neighbor coupling, the staggered-field chain Hamiltonian, and
states Theorem 4.2.

the cyclic successor `x + 1 (mod L)` of `x`, and `0` otherwise.  Summed against `Ŝ_x · Ŝ_y` this
reproduces the periodic chain interaction `Σ_x Ŝ_x · Ŝ_{x+1}` (with `Ŝ_{L+1} = Ŝ_1`). -/

odd sites, so the associated sublattice sign is `ε_x = (−1)^x`.  Used with `staggeredOrderOpS` it

/-- **Tasaki Theorem 4.2 (Shastry no-SSB in 1D), DOCUMENTED AXIOM.**
Tasaki §4.1 footnote 3 (p. 76) explicitly states "We do not prove Theorem 4.2 in
the present book" and refers to Shastry [58] argument (J. Phys. A 25: L249, 1992)
and its rigorous formulation in Tanaka–Takeda–Idogaki [63] (J. Magn. Magn. Mater.
272–276: 908, 2004). Thus Thm 4.2 is a **cite-only documented axiom**.

**Statement (finite-dimensional, iterated limit form)**: For 1D spin-`S`
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ring under staggered field `Ĥ_h = Σ_x Ŝ_x · Ŝ_{x+1}
− h · Ô_L^{(3)}` (eq. (4.1.9)), the per-site staggered order parameter of any
*normalized* ground state vanishes in the iterated limit `lim_{h↓0} lim_{L↑∞}`
(eq. (4.1.10)): for every `ε > 0` there is a field threshold `h₀ > 0` such that
for each field `0 < h < h₀` there is a size threshold `L₀` beyond which every
normalized ground state `Φ` of `staggeredFieldChainHamiltonianS L h N` has
`|⟨Φ, Ô_L^{(3)} Φ⟩.re / L| < ε`.

Here a ground state is a normalized energy-minimizing eigenvector (`Φ ≠ 0`,
`star Φ ⬝ᵥ Φ = 1`, `Ĥ_h Φ = E₀ • Φ` with `E₀.re` minimal over eigenpairs);
normalization makes per-site bound scale-invariant. We record it as a faithful,
sound documented axiom over the concrete ring family. The deep thermodynamic-limit
/ infinite-volume argument (Shastry–Tanaka–Takeda–Idogaki) is deferred (infinite-
volume systems are in scope, routed via the constructive box-to-limit track
#4644). -/
