# Tasaki §5.3 Theorem 5.3: the `U(1)` coherent order-parameter concentration bound (AXIOM)

The final analytic input to the BEC `U(1)` symmetry-breaking Theorem 5.3 is the order-parameter
lower bound `m∗ ≥ √(2 q₀)` (Tasaki §5.3, "As in Theorem 4.11 (p. 101), we can prove the bound
`m∗ ≥ √(2 q₀)`.  See (4.2.39)", pp. 141–142).  The factor `√2` (rather than the `√3` of the
`SU(2)` Theorem 4.11) is the `U(1)` planar isotropy factor: the BEC order operator lives on the two
axes `α = 1, 2` only, so the base ratio saturates at `2 q₀`.

This module records that bound as a **documented axiom** `becMStar_ge_sqrt_twoQ`, the BEC
half-filling counterpart of the `SU(2)` concentration axiom
`orderSqMoment_ratio_le_mStarSq_family` (`AndersonTowerOrderSqConcentration.lean`) and of the
`p̂`-mirror `mStar_eq_phat_ratio_limit` (`OrderOperatorAlgebra.lean`).  Both those axioms pin `m∗`
to its genuine value through an `IsRealizingTanakaGroundStateFamily`; here the pinning is done by
the new `IsRealizingBECCoherentFamily` (the `U(1)` planar analogue: it drops the axis-`1` singlet
`Ŝ^{(1)}_tot Φ = 0` and reversal invariance that the `SU(2)` family carries, keeping only the
half-filling `Ŝ^{(3)}_tot Φ = 0`, so it is directly instantiable by the BEC ground state).

## Why the axiom is stated with `m∗` pinned by a realizing family (over-quantification safety)

If `m∗` were a free parameter one could take `m∗ := 0` together with a genuine long-range-ordered
family (`q₀ > 0`), making `√(2 q₀) ≤ 0` FALSE and `False` derivable (cf. the
`Axiom ∀ must hold for all` discipline; the `SU(2)` sibling documents the same trap).  We instead
pin `m∗` to the genuine coherent order parameter: `IsRealizingBECCoherentFamily` requires the
**uniform window-ratio concentration** (math-note §3.4, refinement 2) — eventually every one-step
ratio `r_M = ⟨Γ_{M+1}, Ô⁺ Γ_M⟩ / L^d` in the (slow) window is within `ε` of `m∗` — which subsumes
the `θ = 0` mean pinning `⟨Ξ_0, Ô^{(1)} Ξ_0⟩ / L^d → m∗` (eq. (5.3.7)) and additionally drives the
second-moment concentration (eq. (5.3.8)) from the same source, fixing `m∗` as the true SSB order
parameter.  The pinned bound `m∗ ≥ √(2 q₀)` is then the genuine "easy half" of the Koma–Tasaki
concentration mechanism (the base ratio `→ 2 q₀`); the matching *equality* `m∗² = 2 q₀`
(Conjecture 4.12's `U(1)` analogue) is a strictly stronger separate statement never asserted here.
The pinned family is unsatisfiable in `d = 1` (no LRO ground state, Corollary 4.3), so the axiom is
vacuous there.

/-- **A realizing BEC coherent family** (Tasaki §5.3, the `U(1)` planar analogue of
`IsRealizingTanakaGroundStateFamily`).  It bundles a half-filling hard-core boson ground-state
family `Φ L` at chemical potential `μ = 0`, together with a slow window `M_win`, so that the order
parameter `m∗` is *pinned* to the genuine coherent order parameter and cannot be a free variable.

The window `M_win` is a **slow window** (`IsSlowBECWindow d C₁ M_win`: monotone, diverging, and
eventually within the nonvanishing tower range `M_win L ≤ C₁ L^{d/2}` — the same binding the
`SU(2)` sibling and `IsBECCoherentSSBConstants` impose).  A bare `Tendsto M_win atTop atTop` is
**insufficient**: a fast window outrunning `C₁ L^{d/2}` would dilute the normalization denominator
and admit a false witness pinning `m∗` below `√(2 q₀)`, an over-quantification defect.

Eventually in even `L`:
* `Φ L` is a nonzero minimizer of the `μ = 0` chemical-potential XY Hamiltonian
  (`xyChemicalPotentialHamiltonianS d L 0`);
* `Φ L` sits at half filling (`Ŝ^{(3)}_tot Φ = 0`; unlike the `SU(2)` family, axis-`1` singlet and
  reversal invariance are **not** imposed — BEC ground states are `U(1)` planar, not `SU(2)`);
* the two planar axes carry ODLRO with constant `q₀` (`⟨(Ô^{(α)})²⟩ / V² ≥ q₀`, `α = 1, 2`);
* the tower states are nonzero across the window (`|M| ≤ C₁ L^{d/2}`), so the `Γ_M` normalize.

The **pinning conjunct** fixes `m∗` as the exact coherent order parameter by the **uniform
window-ratio concentration** (math-note §3.4, 2026-07-17 refinement 2): eventually, for *every* `M`
in the raising window, the one-step off-diagonal ratio `r_M = ⟨Γ_{M+1}, Ô⁺ Γ_M⟩ / L^d` is within
`ε` of `m∗`.  This uniform form is strictly stronger than the `θ = 0` mean pinning
`⟨Ξ_0, Ô^{(1)} Ξ_0⟩ / L^d → m∗` (which it subsumes, that mean being the window average of the
`r_M`) and is exactly what lets *both* the first moments (eq. (5.3.7)) and the second moments
(eq. (5.3.8), the window sums `S₂ = avg r_M²`, `S₁₁ = avg r_M r_{M+1}` — see math-note §2⑤)
converge to `m∗` / `m∗²` **axiom-free** from a single concentration source.  Together with
`0 < m∗` this makes `m∗` the genuine SSB order parameter, the value the documented axiom
`becMStar_ge_sqrt_twoQ` bounds below by `√(2 q₀)`. -/

/-- **Tasaki Theorem 5.3 (the `U(1)` order-parameter lower bound `m∗ ≥ √(2 q₀)`), AXIOM.**  Tasaki
§5.3 states "As in Theorem 4.11 (p. 101), we can prove the bound `m∗ ≥ √(2 q₀)`.  See (4.2.39)"
(pp. 141–142): the BEC coherent order parameter `m∗` is bounded below by `√(2 q₀)`, the `U(1)`
planar (`√2`) counterpart of the `SU(2)` (`√3`) bound of Theorem 4.11.

This is the BEC half-filling counterpart of the `SU(2)` concentration axiom
`orderSqMoment_ratio_le_mStarSq_family` and of the `p̂`-mirror `mStar_eq_phat_ratio_limit`; per the
2026-07-12 no-overreach boundary the Koma–Tasaki [66] concentration mechanism is deferred with
parity to those axioms rather than rebuilt.  `m∗` is **pinned** to its genuine value by
`IsRealizingBECCoherentFamily` (`hFamily`): the uniform window-ratio concentration forces every
one-step ratio `r_M → m∗` in the slow window, so `m∗` is the true SSB order parameter and the bound
is the genuine
"easy half" (`m∗² ≥ 2 q₀`) of [66], never the still-open equality `m∗² = 2 q₀`.  A free `m∗`
would make the statement FALSE (`m∗ := 0` with `q₀ > 0`), hence the family pinning.  The family is
unsatisfiable in `d = 1` (Corollary 4.3), so the axiom is vacuous there. -/
