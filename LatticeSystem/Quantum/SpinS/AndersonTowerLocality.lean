Tasaki §4.2.2 Theorem 4.6 (Anderson tower), Tier 3 (Lemma R2) — locality layer.

This file develops the operator-norm locality of the double commutator
`ĝ_x = [Ô⁺, [ĥ_x, Ô⁻]]` driving the renormalized numerator estimate (Lemma R2, eq. (4.2.68)),
building on the Lemma R1 layer in `AndersonTowerEnergyBound`.
