# Tasaki Appendix A.7: the inductive-limit interface of the box-local tower

The quasi-local `C*`-algebra is the **inductive limit** (norm closure of the
directed union) of the increasing local-algebra tower (Tasaki Appendix A.7).  This
module records that interface for the box-local tower
`A_{Λ_0} ≤ A_{Λ_1} ≤ ⋯` built in `QuasiLocalSupport.lean`:

* the algebraic supremum `A_box = ⨆ₙ A_{Λ_n}` and its **norm closure**, with the
  axiom-free order facts (each box subalgebra sits inside, the supremum sits
  inside `A_loc`, the tower is directed);
* the two genuinely operator-algebraic identifications — that the tower **exhausts**
  the local algebra (`A_loc ≤ A_box`) and that the ambient algebra is the **norm
  closure** of the tower (`closure(A_box) = ⊤`) — recorded as `def : Prop`
  hypotheses (`BoxTowerExhaustsLocalAlg`, `BoxTowerClosureIsQuasiLocalAlgebra`),
  **not asserted**: `LocalSupportData` only supplies the easy inclusion, and the
  reverse needs the finite-support property of the concrete realization.

No new axiom is introduced and no existing axiom is touched.
