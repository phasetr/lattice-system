# Tasaki §8.3.1–§8.3.2: symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases

The Haldane phase cannot be fully characterized by hidden antiferromagnetic order: Gu and Wen
studied the `S = 1` chain with a magnetic field (eq. (8.3.4))
`Ĥ_{D,B} = Σ_x [Ŝ_x·Ŝ_{x+1} + D (Ŝ_x^{(3)})² + B Ŝ_x^{(1)}]`,
whose `B Ŝ_x^{(1)}` term breaks the Z₂ × Z₂ symmetry down to a single Z₂ (the π-rotation about the
1-axis), so the Kennedy–Tasaki picture fails for `B ≠ 0`; yet a distinct, disordered, gapped Haldane
phase (including the Heisenberg point) persists.  Moreover Oshikawa found that the hidden order of
the
spin-`S` VBS state depends on the parity of `S` (eq. (8.3.3)): the string order parameter is
positive
for **odd** `S` and vanishes for **even** `S`, and the AKLT open chain has `(S+1)²`-fold edge
degeneracy (not the four-fold predicted by Z₂ × Z₂).

These observations led to the notion of a **symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase** (§8.3.2).
Two short-range Hamiltonians with a unique gapped ground state are **continuously connected** if
there
is a continuous path of such Hamiltonians joining them.  Without any imposed symmetry, all such 1D
Hamiltonians are connected (Ogata).  But if one fixes a symmetry `G` and requires every Hamiltonian
on the path to be `G`-symmetric, distinct phases can appear: the **trivial phase** contains the
product states, and any other phase under the fixed symmetry is a **(nontrivial) SPT phase**.  The
Haldane phase is the prototypical SPT phase, protected by Z₂ × Z₂ (or inversion / time-reversal).

The Gu–Wen Hamiltonian is *defined concretely*.  The SPT-phase notions (`ContinuouslyConnected`,
`IsTrivialPhase`, `IsSPTPhase`) are honest **`def`s** (never axioms — the SPT phase is a definition,
not a theorem), built on a genuine continuous path of Hamiltonians together with uninterpreted
markers
for the deep predicates (short-range, gapped-unique, product-state, symmetry) whose faithful forms
belong to the infinite-chain / operator-algebra framework.  The Oshikawa parity and the edge
degeneracy are documented axioms.

/-- The **Gu–Wen Hamiltonian** (eq. (8.3.4)) `Ĥ_{D,B} = Σ_x [Ŝ_x·Ŝ_{x+1} + D (Ŝ_x^{(3)})² +
B Ŝ_x^{(1)}]`: the anisotropic `S = 1` chain plus a uniform magnetic field `B` in the 1-direction.
The field term breaks the Z₂ × Z₂ symmetry down to the single Z₂ of the π-rotation about the 1-axis;
at `B = 0` it is the anisotropic model (8.1.1). -/

/-- The **string order parameter of the spin-`S` VBS state** `O_string^{(α)}(Φ_VBS^S)` (Oshikawa),
as a function of the spin `S` and the direction `α`.  An uninterpreted real-valued marker (the
thermodynamic double limit is not formalized). -/
axiom vbsStringOrderParameterS : ℕ → Fin 3 → ℝ

/-- **Tasaki/Oshikawa eq. (8.3.3) (parity dependence of hidden order), AXIOM.**  The hidden
antiferromagnetic order of the spin-`S` VBS state — measured by the string order parameter — is
**positive for odd `S`** and **vanishes for even `S`**: `O_string^{(α)}(Φ_VBS^S) > 0` if `S` is odd,
`= 0` if `S` is even.  So the hidden Z₂ × Z₂ symmetry is fully broken for odd-`S` VBS states but
unbroken for even-`S` ones — a qualitative even/odd-`S` distinction beyond Haldane's integer vs
half-odd-integer one. -/

/-- **Tasaki §8.3.1 (edge-state degeneracy), AXIOM.**  The spin-`S` AKLT model on an open chain has
`(S+1)²`-fold degenerate ground states (the generalized VBS states), from the two effective `S/2`
edge spins.  For even `S` this is not a multiple of four, so it does not fit the Z₂ × Z₂ picture. -/

/-- A **continuous path of Hamiltonians** `Ĥ_s`, `s ∈ [0,1]`, each short-ranged with a unique gapped
ground state: the object along which two gapped phases are compared.  `toFun` is continuous in `s`
and `gapped_unique` holds on the unit interval. -/

and `H₁`.  By Ogata's theorem all short-range gapped-unique 1D Hamiltonians are connected in this
sense. -/

/-- **Symmetry-respecting continuous connection**: a continuous gapped path joining `H₀` and `H₁`
*every Hamiltonian of which* has the imposed symmetry `sym` (a predicate on Hamiltonians, e.g.
`IsZ2Z2Invariant`).  This is the relation that classifies symmetry-protected phases. -/

product-state Hamiltonian.  No matter the symmetry, the trivial product states always form one
phase. -/

/-- **Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase** (relative to `sym`): `H` is short-range
gapped-unique, has the symmetry `sym`, but is **not** in the trivial phase — it cannot be
symmetry-connected to any product state.  The Haldane phase is the prototypical SPT phase, protected
by Z₂ × Z₂ (`IsZ2Z2Invariant`).  This is a definition, not a theorem. -/
