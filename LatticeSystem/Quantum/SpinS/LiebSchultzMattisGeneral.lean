# Tasaki §6.2: the generalized Lieb–Schultz–Mattis variational bound (Lemma 6.4)

Lemma 6.1 (the low energy of the twisted state) generalizes far beyond the standard
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain: it holds for **any** short-ranged, `U(1)`-invariant chain
Hamiltonian
`Ĥ = Σ_{x=1}^{L} ĥ_x`  (eq. (6.2.23)),
where each local term `ĥ_x` acts only on sites within a fixed range `r` of `x` (with periodic
boundary conditions), is bounded `‖ĥ_x‖ ≤ h₀`, and is `U(1)`-invariant,
`(Û_θ^{(3)})† ĥ_x Û_θ^{(3)} = ĥ_x` — equivalently `[ĥ_x, Ŝ_tot^{(3)}] = 0`.

**Lemma 6.4** (eq. (6.2.24)): there is a constant `C > 0`, depending only on `S`, `r` and `h₀`, such
that for *any* ground state `Φ_GS` (uniqueness is **not** assumed) the twisted trial state has
energy `⟨Φ_LSM, Ĥ Φ_LSM⟩ / ⟨Φ_LSM, Φ_LSM⟩ − E_GS ≤ C/L`, for any `L`.

Tasaki further remarks that if `S` is a half-odd integer and the ground state is translation
invariant (`T̂ Φ_GS = e^{iα} Φ_GS`), then *the same orthogonality argument* (a generalization of
Lemma 6.2)
gives `0 ≤ E_1st − E_GS ≤ C/L`, as in Theorem 6.3 — now for a whole class of `U(1)`-invariant
short-ranged chains.  We do **not** formalize that gap consequence here: the formal Lemma 6.2
(`lsm_ground_twist_orthogonal`) is specialized to the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, so
deriving it for a general `IsShortRangeU1Chain` would require a separate generalized orthogonality
lemma.

We record the locality of each `ĥ_x` through the commutant-form locality predicate `IsLocalRangeR`
(`ĥ_x` commutes with every single-site operator farther than `r` from `x`), the norm bound through
the `L²` operator norm `manyBodyOperatorNormS`, and `U(1)`-invariance through
`Commute (ĥ_x) Ŝ_tot^{(3)}`, all bundled into `IsShortRangeU1Chain`.  Lemma 6.4 itself (the `C/L`
variational bound, eq. (6.2.24)) is the documented axiom recorded here.

/-- **Locality marker (commutant form)** `IsLocalRangeR L N r x op`: the operator `op` acts only on
the sites within ring-distance `r` of `x` on `Fin L` (periodic boundary conditions), recorded as the
commutant condition that `op` commutes with *every* single-site operator `onSiteS y A` placed at a
site `y` strictly farther than `r` from `x`.  For a full matrix algebra this is equivalent, by the
factor double-commutant theorem, to `support(op) ⊆ {y : ringDist L x y ≤ r}`, so it is genuine
spatial locality (not merely "enough for Lemma 6.4").  The strong commutant form is deliberate: this
predicate is *shared* as the locality hypothesis of the intentional §7.1.3 Theorem 7.3 axiom
(`IsAKLTPerturbation.local_range`); a weaker form would enlarge that hypothesis class and make
`aklt_theorem_7_3` claim more, risking unsoundness.  For `y` within range the condition is vacuous,
so `op` may act arbitrarily on the local window. -/

/-- **Tasaki Lemma 6.4 (generalized LSM variational bound), AXIOM.**  For the class of short-ranged
`U(1)`-invariant chain Hamiltonians `Ĥ = Σ_x ĥ_x` (`IsShortRangeU1Chain`, range `r`, bound `h₀`,
spin `S = N/2`), there is a constant `C > 0` — depending only on `N`, `r` and `h₀` — such that for
**any** ground state `Φ_GS` (a nonzero eigenvector at the minimal energy `E_GS`; uniqueness is *not*
assumed) the Lieb–Schultz–Mattis trial state has energy bounded by `C/L` above the ground state
(eq. (6.2.24)):
`⟨Φ_LSM, Ĥ Φ_LSM⟩ / ⟨Φ_LSM, Φ_LSM⟩ − E_GS ≤ C/L`, for any `L`.

The constant `C` is uniform over the volume `L`, the local terms `ĥ`, and the ground state — it
depends only on `S`, `r`, `h₀`.  Tasaki remarks that for half-odd-integer `S` with a
translation-invariant ground state a generalized orthogonality argument then yields
`0 ≤ E_1st − E_GS ≤ C/L` (as in Theorem 6.3); that gap consequence is *not* formalized here (the
formal Lemma 6.2 is Heisenberg-chain-specific).  Recorded as a documented axiom. -/
