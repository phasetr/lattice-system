# Lattice spacing as a type-level tag (Phase A of the continuum-limit plan)

The project's long-term goals include the `φ^4` / Ising continuum
limit and lattice-QCD-style formalisations. Both require a notion of
**lattice spacing** `a > 0`, and both ultimately describe the
continuum as the limit `a → 0` of a family of finite-spacing lattice
systems.

At the current formal level every Hamiltonian is indexed by an
abstract vertex type `Λ`, and `a` plays no formal role — all existing
work corresponds to the `a = 1` instance. This module introduces a
**thin type-level tag** recording `a` as metadata on `Λ`, without
altering any existing definition:

* `LatticeWithSpacing Λ` is a one-field type class providing
  `LatticeWithSpacing.spacing : ℝ≥0`.
* `Fin (N + 1)` is given the default instance `spacing := 1` so every
  pre-existing Hamiltonian (chains, rings, Hubbard, Ising, Heisenberg)
  is `rfl`-equivalent to the `spacing := 1` specialisation.

No geometric embedding (lattice points in `ℝ^d`), no coupling
rescaling, no lattice sequence, and no continuum-limit target object
is defined here. Those are phases B-D of the roadmap recorded in
`.self-local/docs/continuum-limit-survey.md` and
`docs/index.md#continuum-limit-roadmap`, and will be introduced only
when a concrete theorem needs them.

The separation follows the codex consultation (2026-04-22) recorded
alongside the survey document: add spacing as *metadata* now, keep
geometry separate, and do **not** generalise `ManyBodyOp Λ = Matrix ...`
to a type class until a second concrete backend is needed.

/-- `LatticeWithSpacing Λ` equips a vertex type `Λ` with a lattice
spacing `a : ℝ≥0` as a type-level tag.

This is a thin, purely metadata-carrying class: no existing
definition in the library consumes it, and the default instance for
`Fin (N + 1)` below uses `spacing := 1`, so the current library is
`rfl`-equivalent to its `LatticeWithSpacing`-tagged specialisation.

The class exists so that future work on the continuum limit
(`a → 0`, cf. `.self-local/docs/continuum-limit-survey.md`) has a
type-level handle on `a`: rescaling of coupling constants, lattice
sequences `a_n → 0`, and renormalisation-group transformations will
all be expressed in terms of `spacing`. -/

/-- Default `spacing := 1` instance for finite chains `Fin (N + 1)`.

With this instance every existing Hamiltonian in the library — built
on `Fin (N + 1)` for the 1D chain, `Fin (2N + 2)` for the spinful
Hubbard chain, etc. — corresponds to the unit-spacing specialisation
of the `LatticeWithSpacing` tag, without any change to existing
definitions or proofs. -/
