# Tasaki Appendix A.7: ground states of infinite systems (Definitions A.25, A.27, Theorem A.26)

For a quantum spin system on `ℤᵈ` the Hamiltonian `Ĥ` is not an element of the quasi-local algebra
`A`, but the commutator `[Ĥ, ·]` is a well-defined `∗`-derivation on the local elements.  We model
the dynamics abstractly by a map `δ : A → A` standing for `Â ↦ [Ĥ, Â]`.

* **Definition A.25 (ground state)** — a state `ω` is a *ground state* iff `ω(Â† [Ĥ, Â]) ≥ 0` for
  every local `Â`; in our notation `0 ≤ ω(star a * δ a)` for all `a`.  (The finite-volume reading is
  `⟨Φ_GS| Â† Ĥ Â |Φ_GS⟩ ≥ E_GS ⟨Φ_GS| Â† Â |Φ_GS⟩`: a local perturbation cannot lower the energy.)
* **Theorem A.26 (variational characterization)** — `ω` is a ground state iff for every `L` the
  energy `ω(Ĥ_L)` of the partial Hamiltonian `Ĥ_L = Σ_{x ∈ Λ_L} ĥ_x` is the least among all states
  `ω′` agreeing with `ω` outside `Λ_L` (eq. (A.7.7)).
* **Definition A.27 (nonzero gap)** — a *unique* ground state `ω` has a *nonzero energy gap* iff
  there is `γ > 0` with `ω(Â† [Ĥ, Â]) ≥ γ ω(Â† Â)` for every local `Â` with `ω(Â) = 0`.

Definitions A.25 and A.27 are genuine `def`s; Theorem A.26 (a deep operator-algebraic result,
[Bratteli–Robinson]) is parametrized by the partial-Hamiltonian family `Ĥ_L` and the constraint sets
`C_L` and recorded as a documented axiom.

/-- **Tasaki Definition A.25 (ground state).**  With the dynamics `δ : A → A` modelling the
Hamiltonian commutator `Â ↦ [Ĥ, Â]`, a state `ω` is a *ground state* iff `0 ≤ ω(Â† [Ĥ, Â])` for
every `Â`, i.e. `0 ≤ ω (star a * δ a)` for all `a : A`.  A local perturbation cannot lower the
energy. -/

/-- **Tasaki Definition A.27 (ground state with a nonzero gap).**  A (unique) ground state `ω`, with
dynamics `δ`, has a *nonzero energy gap* iff there is `γ > 0` with `ω(Â† [Ĥ, Â]) ≥ γ ω(Â† Â)` — i.e.
`(γ : ℂ) * ω (star a * a) ≤ ω (star a * δ a)` — for every `Â` with `ω(Â) = 0`. -/

/-- Abstract predicate marking that `(δ, HL, CL)` are the dynamics, partial Hamiltonians, and
outside-`Λ_L` constraint sets of *one and the same* quantum spin Hamiltonian `Ĥ` on `ℤᵈ`: `δ` is
`[Ĥ, ·]`, `HL L = Ĥ_L = Σ_{x ∈ Λ_L} ĥ_x`, and `CL L = C_L^ω`.  A faithful definition needs
the full quasi-local structure (sites, supports, the family `{ĥ_x}`); it is kept as an uninterpreted
predicate so that Theorem A.26 is stated only for genuine local-Hamiltonian data (and cannot be
applied to unrelated `δ, HL, CL`). -/

/-- **Tasaki Theorem A.26 (variational characterization of ground states), AXIOM.**  Suppose
`(δ, HL, CL)` are the genuine dynamics / partial Hamiltonians `Ĥ_L = Σ_{x ∈ Λ_L} ĥ_x` / constraint
sets `C_L^ω` (states agreeing with `ω` outside `Λ_L`) of one quantum spin Hamiltonian
(`IsLocalHamiltonianData`), with `ω ∈ CL L ⊆` states.  Then `ω` is a ground state iff for every `L`
the energy `(ω(Ĥ_L)).re` is the least value of `(ω′(Ĥ_L)).re` over `ω′ ∈ CL L` (eq. (A.7.7)): a
ground state minimizes every partial Hamiltonian.  Recorded as a documented axiom (conditional on
the local-Hamiltonian compatibility, so it cannot be instantiated with unrelated data). -/
